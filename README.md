# React Planner App

## Description

Productivity app that allows the user to post new 'to do' items to a list and to mark them as complete, which moves the completed item to a ‘done’ list. Additional user features include: edit a post, delete a post, star a post (takes it to the top of the list), reset the app (clears all posts). This app was created using create-react-app and React.
